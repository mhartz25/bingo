# bingo
A simulation of bingo, to see how many turns in an average game. I was inspired to understand a bit more about bingo after watching a Curb Your Enthusiam episode that included it. 

As of now the simulation only includes 1 player. I want to come back and expand this at some point to N amount of players.
